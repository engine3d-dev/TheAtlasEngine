         * @name Vulkan Command Buffer
         * @note Abstraction of our command buffer in Vulkan
         * @note Typically there are a few stages to the command buffer lifecylcle.
         * @param States Allocate (Initial) => Begin (Recording) => End (Execute) => Complete (Submission)
         * @note While chechking during recording if command buffer's invalid then it'll reset back to it's initial state.
         * @note If invalid just before submission then it would complete with a one-time submit(pending) then go through an invalid state before resetting to its initial state.
         * 
         * @param MemoryFragmentation
         * @note Since Vulkan allows for multiple command buffers where users can reset its initial state, be aware to onto cause memory fragmentation.
         * @note For memory fragmentation, Vulkan allows for the notion of VkCommandPool (Command Buffer Pools)
         * @note To think about this is an optimized memory allocator to reduce memory fragmentations tailored for these specific jobs.
         * @note Addition to VkCommandPool must externally and explicitly be synchronized if you want to allocate, record, or reset commands.
         * @note Better approach to this is to allocate a pool for each thread to allow safely recording different command buffers in different threads in parallel. (Which OpenGL does not allow you do to do)
